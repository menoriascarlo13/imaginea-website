			Creating a Social Shopping<br/> APP that is Truly Social!

				<p>We worked with a social shopping company to create an Android app to accompany their already 

					very successful iPhone version. Working with their amazingly talented team, we guided them towards 

					creating an app that genuinely adapted to the Android platform instead of being a mere copy of the 

					iPhone version.</p>
					
						<p>The Android app makes it enjoyable for users to discover - as little or as much they want - buy

							and review their favorite products. Their friends can then make purchase-decisions based on 

							recommendations from a trusted source. Every detail - from choice of fonts to the app's solid backend 

							support - is geared to facilitate a social shopping experience.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="cc-block-b">
							<h2>The results: </h2>
							<ul class="dotted">
								<li>The Android App was listed as a featured app on Google Play within two weeks of launch;</li>
								<li>It was ranked among the top 50 apps on the Google store;</li>
								<li>It launched in time for holidays, wowed shoppers, and made our friends at the social shopping

									company extremely happy</li>

								</ul><p>Here are some reviews from actual users:</p>

<div class="cc-block-b">
							<h2>What Made the App Tick?  </h2>
							<p><span class="bold">Time to Market.</span> The holidays are big business for our client and we understood the urgency. We moved the app from beta play store to public launch in just 2 weeks and got it listed as a featured app within 3 weeks of the public launch.</p>

<p>We leveraged open source tools, adopted an extremely rigorous testing process to keep flaws at a minimum, and integrated Google Play guidelines into the development process. By experience, we knew that paying attention to detail and adhering to Google guidelines would get our app featured. </p>
<p>When using open source, we quickly took stock of the open source design and fixed relevant issues. We removed the redundant common source binaries to minimize application foot-print and chose the libraries only after thorough profiling to optimize memory consumption</p>
<p><span class="bold">A Striking UI and Design that Does Not Compromise on Memory Optimization:</span>  One of biggest challenges with the company was displaying large volumes of high quality images without crashing the user's device. We wanted to maintain performance at all costs and to achieve this we reduced the memory foot-print by caching all images. This is not typical of a mobile app.  Our approach helped us create an impactful design and user experience - critical for influencing shopper behavior - while optimizing memory and minimizing data usage for our client's customers. </p>

<p><span class="bold">Seamless Performance No Matter What Device You Are On:</span>  Having worked with some of the most complicated apps, we knew that a standard design approach would not help manage device fragmentation. We pulled in some amazingly talented designers from our team to create a layout and look that would be supported across Android devices and versions without compromising on the visual appeal of the app.
<p>We took extra care in cross device optimization, maintaining consistency in screen space for orientations (landscape and portrait) and for multiple resolutions. </p>
<p>In the portrait orientation, product images are displayed above the product information. In landscape, product information is displayed beside the image. Another optimization can be seen in the grid view of items. In portrait mode, there are two items per row and in landscape mode there are three items per row.</p>

	<p><span class="bold">Design Elements That Made the App Pop</span></p>
<img class="pic-e-img flt-right" src="images/pic-e.png" />
	<p class="clr-none">An integral part of creating a social shopping experience is connecting friends and showcasing their reviews, ratings, etc. In the Android app, the social element is center stage allowing shoppers to prominently showcase their recommendations and rack up credits.  

	</p>
	<p class="clr-none">We carried the company's brand elements onto the Android app with customization of Basic Android controls to reflect the branding. For e.g. a custom loader instead of standard circular progress bar.</p>
	
	<p class="clr-none">We created custom fonts to give it that "popout" factor. In the Android framework, implementation of custom font is not as straight forward and we created a font manager to manage the fonts and ensure they work efficiently in all Android versions.</p>
	<p class="clr-none">We translated Pixelated iOS designs into Android design with relative layouts making it independent of screen resolution. Specially, the image sizes and alignment which were in pixels were carefully converted to device independent pixels for various resolutions as mdpi,hdpi,xhdpi and xxhdpi. The font size were converted from pixels to scaled pixels for Android.</p>
