            A leading Configure-Price-Quote (CPQ) provider with a rapidly-growing business engaged imaginea to help improve and scale their product and handle customizations for their globally spread-out clients. The CPQ provider helps companies automate their sales order process with dynamic pricing and an easy-to-use workflow approval process. We did end-to-end development of several new product features and handled custom implementations for clients across US, Europe & APAC.

              <p class="italics">"Imaginea worked with the company hand in hand as they focused heavily on product development to support sales. We developed several new features ahead of schedule, delighting our client's customers and helping their sales teams get more efficient."</p>

              <p><span class="bold">The Game Changing Feature:</span> Imaginea fully managed the biggest new addition to our client's CPQ product - a Proposal Editor. The feature allowed sales reps to port their quotes into a document format with a WYSIWYG editor and drag and drop in-text paragraphs. The sales people were able to quickly reuse content and assemble a professional-looking proposals. This new feature became a significant selling point for the product. It was built in less than 9 months, ahead of schedule. This launch preceded what was the turning point in company's growth as they took on several big-name customers.</p>

              <p><span class="bold">Better Configuration Options for Users:</span> Prior product versions included the ability to configure 100-200 line item products, but our client's customers wanted to configure 500 lines or more. We achieved this using XML parsing technologies. We built complex configurators and proposals and implemented E2E project (configurators, commerce, proposals, salesforce.com integration)</p>

              <p><span class="bold">The Unplugged Version:</span> Close on the heels of this product enhancement, we delivered the much-requested "unplugged" version for the CPQ offering. This project required significant intelligence to manage the synchronization of information, data, and rules. This feature has been successfully adopted by several major customers of the company, including Symantec and a division of British Gas, which has over 1,000 sales reps using it.</p>

              <p><span class="bold">Native Reporting Module:</span> Another significant addition was the "native" reporting module. Customers had traditionally been exporting data to other reporting systems increasing workload and syncronization issues. We developed a Java-based solution that pulls the information from the database, allowing sales people extensive reporting capabilities. Using JQuery and JFreeChart, we created a richer UI and drag and drop reports.</p>

              <p><span class="bold">Added Version Control, E-sign Capability:</span> In the CPQ product, there was no version control or a way to identify when two people work on the same item simultaneously. We solved this by developing a Firefox add-on that allowed sales people to collaborate more effectively. We also provided Sales teams the ability to create documents that can be e-signed via a range of systems like Salesforce (docusgin), etc, allowing them to reduce paperwork and time taken to get the relevant signatures and close deals.</p>

              <p><span class="bold">UX/UI Upgrades:</span> We tracker user behavior and actively soliticited feedbactok to drive UX/UI enhancements and provide a better experience to the product users. Leveraging JQuery and GXT we consolidated multiple functions and steps on a single page, and continously upgraded the drag and drop capabilities and the WYSIWYG features.</p>

              <p><span class="bold">Infrastructure and Performance Improvements:</span> On the infrastructure side, we introduced support for SOAP calls and integrated with automated Web service. Our teams brought in AJAX in multiple modules and saw significant performance improvements throughout the projects. We also introduced Spring and Hibernate and rewrote some product features to improve performance.</p>
