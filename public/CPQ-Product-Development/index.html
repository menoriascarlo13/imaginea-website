				<p>A leading Configure-Price-Quote (CPQ) provider helps companies automate their sales order process with a dynamic pricing, and an easy-to-use workflow approval process, accessible anywhere, on any device.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cc-block-b">
				<h2>The Engagement Highlights </h2>
				<ul class="dotted">
					<li>Over 250 customer deployments, 150,000 user licenses and a 95% customer retention rate.</li>
					<li>The company's quoting app was ranked #1 on salesforce.com AppExchange for 4 years. </li>
					<li>Successful acquisition of the company in 2013 by one of the biggest technology companies in the world. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>The company first collaborated with Imaginea in 2007 and continues to leverage our expertise in:</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Product development:</span> Delivering product enhancements and customizations to support customer in High-tech, Manufacturing, Software, Telecoms, Health care, Media, Financial services. </p>

				<p><span class="bold">Professional Services:</span> End to end delivery of several implementations across US, Europe and APAC. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="cc-block-b">
				<h2>The Feature That Changed the Game ...</h2>
				<p>Imaginea fully managed the biggest new addition - <span class="bold">a Proposal Editor</span> - to the company's product. The feature allowed sales reps to port their quotes into a document format with a WYSIWYG editor and to drag and drop in text paragraphs to quickly assemble a professional-looking proposal, while enabling reuse of content.</p>
				<p>This feature was a significant selling point for the product and was built in less than 9 months, beating the customer's expectation of a year. The feature launch preceded what was the turning point in company's growth as they took on several big-name customers. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="cc-block-b">
				<h2>The Customer Asked and We Delivered</h2>
				<p><span class="bold">Improved performance:</span> From a technical perspective, our team brought in <span class="bold">AJAX</span> in multiple modules and saw significant performance improvements throughout the projects. We introduced <span class="bold">Spring</span> and <span class="bold">Hibernate</span> and rewrote some product features to improve performance.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Better Configuration Options for The Product Users:</span> Prior product versions included the ability to configure 100-200 line item products, but customers requested the ability to configure 500 lines or more. We achieved this using <span class="bold">XML parsing technologies.</span> We built complex configurators and proposals and implemented <span class="bold">E2E project</span> (configurators, commerce, proposals, salesforce.com integration).</p>



			</div> 
			<div class="cc-block-b">
				<h2>...And then there was No Looking Back!</h2>
				<p><span class="bold">The Unplugged Version:</span> Close on the heels of this product enhancement, we created the much-requested "unplugged" version, requiring significant intelligence to manage the synchronization of information, data, and rules. </p>
				<ul class="dotted">
					<li>Imaginea was the core product development team for this feature. </li>
					<li>It has been successfully implemented by several major customers of the company, including Symantec and a division of British Gas, which has over 1,000 sales reps using it.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><span class="bold">Native Reporting Module:</span> Another significant addition was the "native" reporting module. Some 2010 customers had been exporting data to other reporting systems, but we developed a Java-based solution that pulls the information from the database. We used <span class="bold">JQuery</span> and <span class="bold">JFreeChart</span> to a richer UI and drag and drop reports.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Added Version Control, E-sign Capability to Product:</span> The CPQ product had no way to version control the changes or to identify when two people work on the same item simultaneously. A Firefox add-on called <span class="bold">Composure</span> was developed to achieve this. Solutions to creating documents that can be e-signed via multiple systems like Salesforce (docusgin), were created. </p>

				<p><span class="bold">The Infrastructure Upgrade:</span> On the infrastructure side, we introduced support for SOAP calls and integrated with automated Web services. </p>

				<p><span class="bold">Redefined the UX/UI:</span> The key focus for 2011 was an emphasis on usability through major enhancements to the UX/UI. Leveraging <span class="bold">JQuery</span> and <span class="bold">GXT</span>, we were able to consolidate multiple functions and steps on a single page, making upgrades to the drag and drop capabilities and the WYSIWYG features.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Code Coverage:</span> On the back end, we began a process of expanding the unit test bases to ensure code coverage. This is critical to ensure that older code doesn't break as new code is added to the platform. The initial coverage was less than 1% and it has moved to over 15% in the interim.</p>
