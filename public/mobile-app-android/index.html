				<p>At Imaginea, we've worked with some of the brightest technology companies to create some amazing apps including the Android app for social retail pioneer, Luvocracy. The app, which launched during the holidays, ranked among the top 50 apps on Google play within one week and delivered a near perfect user experience - allowing consumers to review, rate and get the best deals on the things they love - all in one place.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cc-block-a">
				<h2>Guidelines for Android App Development:</h2>
				<p>Working with Luvocracy and clients across several other industries, we've developed some guidelines specific to Android app development and are sharing our learnings with you. </p>
				<div class="cc-panel">
					<h4><label class="label-plus">+</label><label class="label-minus">-</label>The Android Launch Checklist</h4>
					<p>This is your starting point. Knowing what it takes to get your app published in the Play Store sets you up for early success. It's far easier and highly recommended that you follow Andorid best practices during the development process instead of thinking about it right before the app is ready for publishing.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="cc-panel">
					<h4><label class="label-plus">+</label><label class="label-minus">-</label>Optimize across Devices</h4>
					<p>Having your app ready for both phone and tablet puts you in a favorable position with Google. Right at the onset of development, factor in how your app performs and looks in each environment. It's a best practice to design different layouts for different screen orientations (landscape and portrait) across devices and ensure visual assets are optimized for different resolutions. For example, your screen items may stretch out in a tablet in landscape orientation if not previously optimized. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="cc-panel">
					<h4><label class="label-plus">+</label><label class="label-minus">-</label>Support Multiple SDK but Set Your Limit</h4>
					<p>In Android, supporting across SDKs is one of the biggest challenges for developers. Be prepared for dealing with the challenges of device fragmentation. Our two cents. It's a good idea to decide what range of SDK you can reasonably support. In our experience, 10 (Ginger Bread, 2.3.3 - 19 (KitKat, 4.4.2) is a good number. It's easier to manage when you undertake UI overhauls, not to mention managing the burden of testing across devices. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="cc-panel">
					<h4><label class="label-plus">+</label><label class="label-minus">-</label>Memory Optimization</h4>
					<p>The most significant performance issues with Mobile applications arise from how they interact with the device memory or vice-versa. A minor mismatch and the application will crash; often multiples times in a day, frustrating users. For example, e-retail apps need to display high quality images in large volumes and support long browsing sessions as users take their time to shop. This will impact your app performance unless you preemptively tested it for such scenarios. Memory defects testing and app optimization for performance in a variety of memory-usage scenarios is nearly impossible to achieve manually, so plan for automation.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="cc-panel">
					<h4><label class="label-plus">+</label><label class="label-minus">-</label>Leverage Android's Quick Approval Process to Your Advantage</h4>
					<p>While there are no set rules, in our experience we've found that an app for Google Play can be approved and hit the stores as quickly as 4-6 hours after submission. A word of caution! While this speedy approval allows developers to quickly push updates and changes to the app, beware of pushing out buggy updates. Take the time to test - combine automation and manual testing for each and every submission to the Play store. </p>

				<h2>A success story: Luvocracy  </h2>
				<p>We worked with Luvocracy to create an Android app to accompany their already very successful iPhone version. Working with their amazingly talented team, we guided them towards creating an app that genuinely adapted to the Android platform instead of being a mere copy of the iPhone version. </p>
			</div>


			
			<div class="cc-block-e">
				<div class="cc-panel ccp-clear">
					<h3><i><span class="cc-more">+ <label>The Issue</span><span class="cc-less">- <label>The Issue</label></span></i></h3>
					<p>Luvocracy wanted to develop a mobile app that can run across multiple heterogeneous devices as they differ considerably at the hardware level. Even the software development environments are also very different.</p>					
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="cc-block-e">
				<div class="cc-panel ccp-clear">
					<h3><i><span class="cc-more">+ <label>The Solution</span><span class="cc-less">- <label>The Solution</label></span></i></h3>
					<p>We created the app to mirror Luvocracy's goal to allow its users to "discover, share and shop the things they love".</p>
					<p>The Android app makes it enjoyable for users to discover - as little or as much they want - buy and review their favorite products. Their friends can then make purchase-decisions based on recommendations from a trusted source. Every detail - from choice of fonts to the app's solid backend support - is geared to facilitate a social shopping experience.  </p>

				<p style="font-style:italic">"It has truly been a pleasure working with Imaginea on the development of our native Android app. The team constantly questioned the standard approach and created an app which is most effective for the Android platform. Post launch, we thought of adding some new features and they quickly translated what were experimental thoughts into successful launch of new features. The team has always jumped on opportunities and continues to demonstrate great aptitude on the Android platform."</p>
