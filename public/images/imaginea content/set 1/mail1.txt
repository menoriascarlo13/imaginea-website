Hi,

 

I haven't gotten feedback on these yet--and there are a few questions in them, but for the sake of speed, I think we're better off getting the pages laid out & then we can tweak the copy as needed. There's a blurb for the first 4 areas, I'll send the last one tonight.

Chandru, let me know what I should do in WordPress--will you provide a template that I'll update?

 

When do you think there will be a working mockup of the Services Section that we can review?

 

Best,
Abby
