<h1 class="orange">APIs for Enterprise</h1>
<h2>The thumping success of APIs in the consumer space has 

pushed them to be a part of emerging platforms for the 

enterprise.</h2>
  
<p> After witnessing the success of API-based development and its growth in social

media and the consumer space, enterprises are now keen on replicating the same 

success in their businesses.</p>
  <p>The new API architecture is transforming the way enterprises work. APIs are

not just an aid to achieve business goals; they are also at the core of business 

strategy. They are opening up new business channels and speeding up change in 

partner businesses.</p>
  <p>Enterprises are compelled to create new applications that appeal to different

markets and customer segments. But they also have to ensure that these 

applications are accessible to a variety of user-agents. Cloud applications that 

provide visual representation of information need a standard way to circle back 

data and functions that reside in internal systems. Achieving all this is much easier 

and quicker with APIs.</p>
    <p>APIs are a current trend, but they’ve always existed. Today’s web API architecture

provides loose coupling and extensive reuse which speeds up development. But 

it also has its drawbacks: enterprises do not need APIs that are isolated and not 

in line with their business needs. What they do need is a holistic approach to 

include APIs in their business strategies and more importantly, to make APIs their 

business.</p>
    <h5>Building good APIs</h5>
    <p>Badly designed APIs are messy and can prove to be more expensive than they are 

worth. Good APIs on the other hand, are marked by key design features that are 

implemented through a strong API architecture and design.</p>
  <img src="/images/api-design.png" style="margin:0 auto;margin-bottom:40px;display:block">
    <p>With a good understanding of enterprise API strategies, best practices and 

sufficient integration expertise, your business can create robust API designs too.</p>
    <h5>Why is engineering critical for APIs?</h5>
    <p>If APIs are all about interfaces and integration, do they require engineering? 

Absolutely! Strong engineering and development skills help:</p>
  
<dl>
	
	<dd>
		<ul class="dotted">
<li>Create a sustainable, low-level API design that can reduce the actual

development time</li>

<li>Evaluate and choose a perfect implementation technology stack</li>

<li>Optimize and implement APIs</li>

<li>Automate tests for APIs</li>
</ul>
	</dd>
</dl>
    <p>Only good engineering can ensure great developer experience. And APIs are all 

about Developer Experience (DX).</p>
  <img src="/images/api-lifecycle.png" style="margin:0 auto; display:block;">
  <h5>Do APIs need management?</h5>
    <p>Some level of management is required to avoid confusion and chaos. These

management needs are largely driven by the relevance of the APIs to the business 

core and the existing IT landscape.</p>
    <p>For instance, new APIs may require authentication and authorization logic for 

security, but this might already exist in the enterprise IAM. So in this case, there is 

an obvious need for integration with the enterprise IAM.</p>
    <p>Another set of APIs may need access limitation policies. While this can be 

managed from an API publishing application, it is better to solve the problem in a 

more standard way to avoid other concerns.</p>
    <p>Imaginea is partnering with best-of-breed API products in the market so its 

customers can realize the full potential of new architectures.</p>
