<h5>Why APIs for Enterprise</h5>
<p>The thumping success of APIs in the consumer space has pushed APIs to be part of emerging platforms. 

After seeing huge success of API-based development and subsequent growth in social media and 

consumer space, in general, enterprises are now keen to replicate that in their business.. The new API 

architecture is transforming the way business is done. For, APIs are not just an aid to achieve their 

business goals, but are core to the business strategy. APIs are opening up newer business channels and 

speeding up partner interactions. Internally too, API adoption is helping processes keep pace with 

business change. </p>

<p>Enterprises are compelled to create newer applications that appeal to different markets and 

customer segments, and make them accessible to a variety of user-agents. Visual representation and 

communication of data and information . Cloud applications need a standard way to circle back data and 

functions within internal systems. Achieving all these is much easier and quicker with APIs.</p>

<p>While it is currently trending in enterprises, APIs havealways existed. The current day web API 

architecture provides a loose coupling and extensive reuse. While this makes development fater, a 

note of caution: enterprises do not need APIs that are isolated and are not in line with business needs. 

Enterprises need a holistic approach to include APIs in their business strategy. And more so, to make 

APIs their business.
</p>


<h5>Building good APIs</h5>
<p>Badly designed APIs can create mess and can prove to be more expensive than its worth. Key 

design features mark good APIs. Strong API architecture and design is critical to ensure the right 

implementation of these key features.</p>
<p>With good understanding of the enterprises’ API strategy, use of best practices, sufficient integration 

expertise, your business can serve a as a good base for creating a robust API design.</p>

<h5>Why engineering is critical for APIs</h5>
<p>Often asked: if APIs are about interface and integration, is engineering critical for APIs? Absolutely!

Strong engineering and development minds are needed for:</p>

	<dd>
		<ul class="dotted">
<li>Creating a sustainable low level design for APIs that can reduce the actual development time</li>

<li>Evaluating and choosing a perfect implementation technology stack for APIs</li>

<li>Optimizing and performing APIs</li>

<li>Automatingtests for the APIs</li>
</ul>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>Only good engineering can ensure a good developer experience. APIs are all about Developer Experience 

(DX).</p>

<h5>Do I really need to manage my APIs? Is Management tool a must?</h5>
<p>Well, yes. Some level of management is required to avoid chaos. The relevance of APIs to core business 

and existing IT landscape largely drives the those management needs. For instance, new APIs that 

need security need authentication and authorization logic, which might already exist in the enterprise 

IAM. This is an obvious need to integrate with the enterprise IAM. There can be another set of APIs that 

need some access limitation policies. While these can probably be managed from an API publishing 

application, these are wide concerns and better solved in a standard way.</p>

<p>WaveMaker Gateway helps in handling all the general concerns that comes along with APIs. Imaginea is 

a preferred professional services provider for WaveMaker Gateway.</p>

<p>Tools can certainly manage APIs but only to the extent it is configured. Enterprises most certainly need 

experts to evaluate and configure the best tool for their purpose. We also offer services on other API 

Management Tools</p>

<p>A complete API Management product can be very useful but is not mandatory to venture into APIs.

Nevertheless, even the simplest API implementation will need ways to make the APIs discoverable, 

understandable, and at least minimally secured.</p>

<p>Simply get started with WaveMaker Gateway Lite. Postpone your worries about procuring a commercial

API Management tool even before you are sure about your APIs.</p>

<p>You may have APIs but creating API driven smart web & mobile applications is time consuming 

and difficult without the right tools.</p>
<p>Many enterprises are in a state that is unable to realize the investments made in APIs. Using a tool 

like Wavemaker Stydio, creating API driven applications to be served on web and mobile is no longer 

time consuming or difficult. The Studio is a visual RAD tool that offers you ways to drag-and-drop UI 

components, connect to web services, and create database schemas -- without writing any code.</p>

<h5>Our Experience with APIs</h5>

<p>WaveMaker, Inc. provides App Enablement Suite (AES), an end-to-end solution for publishing, managing 

APIs and uniquely promoting API consumption. WaveMaker improves API consumption by empowering 

the large population of user developers, as well as professional developers, to create API apps.</p>

<p>WaveMaker is a portfolio company of Pramati Technologies. Imaginea has been serving as the 

engineering arm for the WaveMaker product suite. Building a commercial grade API Management 

Gateway has given us immense insight in to different aspect of API building, publishing and consuming.</p> 

<p>The product DNA in Imaginea has always ensured high quality deliverables and very happy customers. </p>
