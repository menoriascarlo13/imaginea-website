							<h5>"After migrating our critical apps to public-private clouds we have had zero infrastructure issues"</h5>
							<p>Along with  growth, organizations are forced to increase their application portfolios , adopt newer technologies, implement new business processes  and adhere to current regulatory requirements.

We have proven strategy and history of executing this successfully be it in a private or public cloud without any business disruptions.
</p><p>Application Portfolio Migration engagement addresses key questions:

</p>

							<ul class="dotted">
								<li>Though most apps can be redesigned to suit cloud application architectures, the task of re-architecting some applications can be more trouble than it's worth. </li>
								<li>The decision to migrate a legacy application to the cloud relies on one question: Does it make financial sense to commit the necessary manpower and money to reconfigure an app for the cloud? </li>
