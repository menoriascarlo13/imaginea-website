<h5>Why APIs for Enterprise</h5>
<p>The thumping success of APIs in the consumer space has pushed APIs to be part of emerging platforms. 

After seeing huge success of API-based development and subsequent growth in social media and 

consumer space, in general, enterprises are now keen to replicate that in their business.. The new API 

architecture is transforming the way business is done. For, APIs are not just an aid to achieve their 

business goals, but are core to the business strategy. APIs are opening up newer business channels 

and speeding up partner

business change.</p>

<p>Enterprises are compelled to create newer applications that appeal to different markets and

customer segments, and make them accessible to a variety of user-agents. Visual representation and 

communication of data and information Cloud applications need a standard way to circle back data and 

functions within internal systems. Achieving all these is much easier and quicker with APIs.</p>

<p>While it is currently trending in enterprises, APIs have always existed. The current day web API 

architecture provides a loose coupling and extensive reuse. While this makes development faster, a 

note of caution: enterprises do not need APIs that are isolated and are not in line with business needs. 

Enterprises need a holistic approach to include APIs in their business strategy; more so, to make APIs 

their business.
</p>


<h5>Building good APIs</h5>
<p>Badly designed APIs can create mess and can prove to be more expensive than its worth. Key 

design features mark good APIs. Strong API architecture and design is critical to ensure the right 

implementation of these key features.</p>

<p>With good understanding of the enterprisesâ€™ API strategy, use of best practices, sufficient integration 

expertise, your business can serve a as a good base for creating a robust API design.</p>

<h5>Why engineering is critical for APIs</h5>
<p>Often asked: if APIs are about interface and integration, is engineering critical for APIs? Absolutely!

Strong engineering and development minds are needed for:</p>

	<dd>
		<ul class="dotted">
<li>Creating a sustainable low level design for APIs that can reduce the actual development time</li>

<li>Evaluating and choosing a perfect implementation technology stack for APIs</li>

<li>Optimizing and performing APIs</li>

<li>Automating tests for the APIs</li>
</ul>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>Only good engineering can ensure a good developer experience. APIs are all about Developer Experience 

(DX).</p>

<h5>Do I really need to manage my APIs? Is Management tool a must?</h5>
<p>Well, yes. Some level of management is required to avoid chaos. The relevance of APIs to core business 

and existing IT landscape largely drives the those management needs. For instance, new APIs that 

need security need authentication and authorization logic, which might already exist in the enterprise 

IAM. This is an obvious need to integrate with the enterprise IAM. There can be another set of APIs that 

need some access limitation policies. While these can probably be managed from an API publishing 

application, these are wide concerns and better solved in a standard way.</p>

<p>Imaginea is partnering best of breed API products in the market so that its customers can realize the full 

potential of APIs. WaveMaker Gateway helps in handling all the general concerns that comes along with 

APIs. Imaginea is a preferred professional services provider for WaveMaker Gateway.</p>

<p>Tools can certainly manage APIs but only to the extent it is configured. Enterprises most certainly need

experts to evaluate and configure the best tool for their purpose. We also offer services on other 

commercial API Management Tools like Layer7, 3Scale, Mulesoft etc.</p>
<p>A complete API Management product can be very useful but is not mandatory to venture into APIs. 

Nevertheless, even the simplest API implementation will need ways to make the APIs discoverable, 

understandable, and at least minimally secured.</p>
<p>Simply get started with WaveMaker Gateway Lite. Postpone your worries about procuring a commercial 

API Management tool even before you are sure about your APIs.</p>

<p class="italics flt-left" style="margin:10px 0px 0px 40px;padding-left:40px; border-left:1px solid #ccc; font-style:italic;">WM Gateway Lite is a free to use light weight API management solution.</p>
<h5>Fast-track web and mobile app development</h5>
<p>You may have APIs but creating API driven smart web & mobile applications is time consuming

and difficult without the right tools.</p>
<p>Many enterprises are in a state that is unable to realize the investments made in APIs. Using a tool

like Wavemaker Studio, creating API driven applications to be served on web and mobile is no longer 

time consuming or difficult. The Studio is a visual RAD tool that offers you ways to drag-and-drop UI 

components, connect to web services, create database schemas and much more-- without writing any 

code.</p>
