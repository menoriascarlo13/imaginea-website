<h1 class="orange">Partnerships</h1>
<h2>Imaginea is partnering with best-of-breed technology providers 

in the market so its customers can realize the full potential of 

new API architectures. Tools can manage APIs, but only to the 

extent dictated by their configurations. Enterprises definitely 

need experts to evaluate and configure a tool that suits their 

purpose best.</h2>

<p>WaveMaker Gateway helps handle all the general concerns that come along with

APIs. And Imaginea is the preferred professional service provider for WaveMaker 

Gateway.</p>
<p>Tools can manage APIs, but only to the extent that their configurations allow. So 

enterprises do need experts to evaluate and configure a tool that best matches 

their requirements. Imaginea also offers services on other commercial API 

Management tools like Layer7, 3Scale, Mulesoft etc.</p>
<p>A complete API Management product can be very useful, but it is not

mandatory to get one to venture into APIs. Nevertheless, even the simplest 

API implementation will need some way to make the API discoverable, 

understandable, and at least minimally secure.</p>
<p>Get started with WaveMaker Gateway Lite, and you won’t have to worry about

getting a commercial API Management tool even before you are sure about your 

APIs.</p>


<h5>Fast-track web and mobile app development</h5>
<p>You may already have APIs, but creating smart API-driven web & mobile 

applications is time consuming and difficult without the right tools. Because of 

this, many enterprises are unable to recover their investment in APIs.</p>
<p>With a tool like WaveMaker Studio, creating API-driven web and mobile apps

is no longer time consuming or difficult. The WaveMaker Studio is a visual RAD 

tool that lets you drag-and-drop UI components, connect to web services, create 

database schemas and much more – all without writing any code.</p>
