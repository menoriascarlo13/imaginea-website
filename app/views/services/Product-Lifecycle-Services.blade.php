<h1>Full scale product development and roll out</h1>
<h2 > You have the inspiration for a product that will change the course of your business, but it's a long way from reality even though you've done your market research. You run a lean organization and your resources are committed to programs that you can't abandon. </h2>

	<h5>An Imaginea Engagement<h5>
	<p class="italic">
		A large technology company formed a joint venture with a travel data company to create a mobile app with travel and entertainment information for visitors to New York. Imaginea was selected to manage the full project lifecycle starting with application development. Our primary focus was on stringent mobile usability requirements, battery management, and multilingual capabilities.
	</p>
	<p class="read-more-content italic">
		This project exemplifies the challenges of developing usable applications for mobile
		devices. Usability and battery management is essential for a mobile traveller who's inundated with information that uses location services. The
		application had to be easy-to-use, yet quickly present
		appropriate and localized recommendations. Imaginea was selected for our expertise in mobile product development since neither of the partnering companies had the bandwidth nor expertise to carry out the project.

<p>
	In a shifting market you can't afford to ignore nimble competitors and disruptive technologies. Hiring a full team is impossible: it takes too long, talent is scarce, and the risk is too high. But sitting back forgoes the opportunity. So how do you seize it?
</p>
<p>
	Imaginea is well staffed in the critical technologies that drive innovative products today. We've created full-scale, production-ready products for clients around the globe. We've also done it for the trickiest client of them all: ourselves. Our track record includes companies spun off by our corporate parent, Qontext (acquired by Autodesk) and SocialTwist. Their products were envisioned and developed in our labs.
</p>
<p>
	We can do the same for your business. We can build the product you're dreaming of, quickly and cost-effectively.
