		<h1>Prototype and test your solution</h1>
		<h2> Emerging technologies have presented you with a market opportunity, but the gap between idea and product can be unbridgeable. Before you launch into full-scale product development, you need to build momentum for your idea. </h2>

			<h5>An Imaginea Engagement</h5>
			<p class="italic">
				A book publishing company was considering opportunities in the emerging eBook market. They asked Imaginea to create a working prototype to help them generate customer feedback and gain investor buy-in. The app was developed in a rapid, iterative process, allowing them to test the concept and gain support for full-scale development.
			</p>
			<p class="read-more-content italic">
				Go-to-market decisions on a new product or idea can be
				complicated and political. External agents like investors and customers
				must be won over. A working 1.0 product gave
				this company a platform of legitimacy to garner support and funding. Imaginea understands such requirements and constraints. We worked closely with the client team to deliver the functionality they needed, within
				their time and budget.

			You need proof-points to win the support of critical players like senior management and corporate sponsors. Or even investors and major customers. Powerpoint has run out of gas; what you need now is a credible prototype for your stakeholders. Your working proof-of-concept is your ticket to executive support, customer engagement, and investment.
		</p>
		<p>
			How will you find the right resources to build this on your day job while managing your business? Expertise in disruptive technologies is scarce and legacy mindsets can inhibit new ideas.
			Imaginea bridges that gap. Our team is ready and well-versed in today's disruptive technologies of social, mobile, cloud and big data. We can build your proof-of-concept and the momentum you need to capture that market opportunity before you.
