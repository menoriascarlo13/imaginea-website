<h1>Identify the right technology for your solution</h1>

	<h5>An Imaginea Engagement</h5>
	<p class="italic">
		A major financial services provider's CIO set a goal to migrate their desktop applications to the cloud. The team came to us for help selecting a platform that met their current public cloud requirements, but needed to plan ahead for future private cloud deployments for major customers. We identified AWS as the best fit, implemented it, and provided a migration program for their desktop apps.

	<p class="read-more-content italic">
		Often IT departments instinctively lean towards technology choices driven by their own experience and comfort. Sometimes these don't turn out to be the best fit and result in applications with functional gaps and scalability challenges.
		With our experience across multiple technologies, Imaginea was able to
		offer our customer an unbiased assessment of available platforms and present the best
		choice for their business needs—in this case, Amazon Web Services (AWS)—keeping
		in mind their future plans. Rather than abandoning them with a Powerpoint
		deck, we implemented the solution and worked closely with their internal team to
		ensure a smooth migration and hand-off.
